# GoogleNewsSpider
Provided a list of URL in a XLSX file, this bot crawls every URL and writes the status(Approved/Not-Approved) in the file.

Add the sites in the test.xlsx file in the first column and make sure 2nd column is always null.

Head over to directory where you have the GoogleNewsSpider.py, and run GoogleNewsSpider.py.

If you get error while crawling like exception occured than wait for sometime, beacause google has identified you as a bot. Add interval between each crawl to avoid the error.
